# Automation-for-the-Lab

This is my automation to extract patient test results

# Why was it necessary?

After Covid tests are performed in the laboratory, the results are recorded one by one for patients who will go abroad. Unfortunately, the ministry software does not have the authority to download a mass. This software I made records one by one directly from the site prepared for patients. Since we already have the necessary patient information, the process is done with an excel table.

# What was used?

Python and Python in selenium, webdriver, xlrd.
